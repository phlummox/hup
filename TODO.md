# TODO

- switch from cmdargs to optparse-applicative: the latter seems to
  use less magic, fewer extensions, and I'm just more familiar with it.
- allow extra args to be passed onto stack (e.g. "--stack-yaml")

- Throw a custom error type in the lib, don't use userError

- In the Makefile, link to a more permanent location for the QEMU image
