# TODO

- switch from cmdargs to optparse-applicative: the latter seems to
  use less magic, fewer extensions, and I'm just more familiar with it.
- move 'src' to 'app', and 'lib' to 'src' - seems to be a more typical
  convention. (It's the one used by most `stack` templayes, anyway.)
- maybe swithc from use of `simple` from tests to servant?
  might be simpler.
